## What is OAuth2
OAuth2 is an open standard that allows users to authorize third-party applications to access their information stored on another service provider without having to provide their username and password to the third-party application or share all the contents of their data. For more information, please refer to [OAuth2](https://oauth.net/2/).

It is used for user login in this project. Users can log in using a third-party account without registering a new account.

## Key parameters of OAuth2
### Client ID
The client ID is generated by the server when applying for an application, and this value is public.

### Client Secret
The client key is generated by the server when applying for an application. This value is confidential and must not be disclosed to third parties.

### Callback URL
The callback address is the address where the server jumps back to the client after the user authorizes it. The callback address is filled in when applying for an application. It is usually a page address on the client and is used to receive the authorization result from the server.

In `SyncTV`, the callback address is `https://<your-domain>/web/oauth2/callback/<oauth2-provider>`

For example, the callback address of `Github` is `https://<your-domain>/web/oauth2/callback/github`

> If you are a developer, you can use `http://localhost:8080/oauth2/callback/github` as the callback address. This address does not depend on the front-end page.
>
> The login address is `http://localhost:8080/oauth2/login/github`
